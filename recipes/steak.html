		<h2>Final steak</h2>
		<p>Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
			<li>⅓ cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
			<li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
			<li>1 ½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
			<li>Whisk together oil, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and pepper for marinade until thoroughly combined. Place steak in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</li>
			<li>Pour marinade over flank steak in the baking dish; turn several times to coat thoroughly with marinade. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours, or up to 12 hours if you have time.</li>
			<li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
			<li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
